## What is NLP ?

NLP tries to detect and modify unconscious biases or limitations of an individual's map of the world. NLP is not hypnotherapy. Instead, it operates through the conscious use of language to bring about changes in someone's thoughts and behavior.

## What is NLP used for?

Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

## What is NLP in machine learning?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the part of AI that studies how machines interact with human language. ... Combined with machine learning algorithms, NLP creates systems that learn to perform tasks on their own and get better through experience.

## Arabic NLP 

Arabic is the largest member of the Semitic language family and is spoken by nearly 500 million people worldwide. It is one of the six official UN languages. Despite its cultural, religious, and political significance, Arabic has received comparatively little attention in modern computational linguistics. We are remedying this oversight by developing tools and techniques that deliver state-of-the-art performance in a variety of language processing tasks. Machine translation is our most active area of research, but we have also worked on statistical parsing and part-of-speech tagging. This page provides links to our freely available software along with a list of relevant publications.
